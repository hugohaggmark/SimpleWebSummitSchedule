Cindyâ€™s international playing career was cut short at the age of 25, when she was 5th all-time leading scorer, due to post-concussion syndrome. Transitioning from playing to coaching, Cindy continued her winning ways by leading her team to a professional league championship in 2013, and added 4 collegiate championships to the 2 she won as a player. At the age of 35, she became the youngest coach to win an American professional championship in any sport. Due to her lingering issues with concussion and the fact that girls soccer is the second leading sport in concussion incidence (second only to football), Cindy has become a passionate advocate for solving sportsâ€™ concussion crisis.

    "bio": "Tien Tzuo, widely recognized as one of the thought leaders in the software-as-a-service industry, founded Zuora in 2008 and serves as Chief Executive Officer. As Zuora's CEO, Tzuo has evangelized this shift to subscription based business models and the complex billing structures they inherit, coining the phrase Subscription Economy. Under his leadership, Zuora has become one of the fastest growing SaaS companies, carries an extensive list of prestigious industry awards, and became cash-flow positive at a record rate. Before Zuora, Tzuo was one of the original forces at salesforce.com, joining as employee number 11. In his 9 years at salesforce.com, Tzuo built salesforce.com's original billing system and held a variety of executive roles in technology, marketing, and strategy organizations, including building out the product management \u0026 marketing organization, serving as Chief Marketing Officer for two years, and most recently as Chief Strategy Officer. Prior to salesforce.com, Tzuo was at CrossWorlds Software, where he launched CrossWorlds' Telecommunications business unit focused on integration with billing systems such as Portal, Kenan, Amdocs, and MetaSolv. Earlier, at Oracle Corporation he managed several of Oracle's largest Telecommunications accounts, including MCI, NYNEX, Bell Atlantic (now Verizon), and AT\u0026T.  "
